# Proteomics activities in CHM696

Proteomics tutorial and assignment in CHM696, a graduate-level chemical biology course at Purdue University. 

## Proteomics Tutorial

Usage of MSFragger and the GUI FragPipe are introduced.

Visit the [tutorial](01_proteomics_tutorial.md) for more information about how to get started.

## Chemical Proteomics Assignment

For Problem Set 4, students will analyze public data from covalent ligand discovery experiments.

## Requirements

These activities are intended to be conducted on the [Scholar compute cluster](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/scholar) maintained by RCAC but can be accomplished on similarly configured systems with the following:

- Apptainer image containing [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/), [MSFragger](https://msfragger.nesvilab.org/), and [IonQuant](https://ionquant.nesvilab.org/)
- Workload manager like [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)

## Issues?

If you encounter problems with instructions or shell scripts, submit an [Issue](https://github.com/bdrown/chm696-docking/issues). If you are a CHM696 student, please contact Prof. Drown via email.
